        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This jackfruit recipe is a great addition to taco night for plant-based eaters</p>
        <p>Jackfruit is a tropical fruit found in parts of Asia, Africa and South America that has the ability to absorb flavors and can be prepared to have a texture similar to shredded chicken</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>20 oz can of Jackfruit packed in water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil divided</li>
            <li>1/2 a red onion, diced (one cup) or one fat shallot</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 jalepeno, finely diced (add more or less depending on spice preferencee</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce ot liquid amino acid</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dry Mexican oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar for caramelization</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Drain the jackfruit and cut into very thin slices, slicing through the core</li>
            <li>Place it in the middle of a kitchen towel, roll it up and wring it out very very firm. Squeeze out as much water as you can. You should see quite a bit of liquid release.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil (save the other tablespoon for later) and saute the onion, garlic and jalapeno over medium heat until deeply golden and fragrant, about 5-6 minutes stirring often. Be patient here, this is where  the flavor is.</li>
            <li>Add the jackfruit, and soy sauce and stir well and lower heat. This is where you’ll let the moisture cook-off even more- you want to get this fairly dry but without burning. So low heat, stirring occasionally, uncovered, 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>When it seems good and dry, add the salt, sugar and spices- chili powder, cumin, oregano smoked paprika, and add 1 tablespoon olive oil, stir-frying the spices and jackfruit a bit until jackfruit begins to caramelize crisp and deepen in color. It should smell amazing!</li>
            <li>Taste, and adjust salt and spice level ( feel free to add cayenne, ground chipotle or more smoked paprkita). For more tang, squeeze with lime, keeping in mind jackfruit has a natural tanginess, so taste it first.</li>
            <li>Use Jackfruit Carnitas in tacos, enchiladas, burrito or burrito bowls, breakfast bowls.</li>
        </ol>
